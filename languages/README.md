# Web chat language configuration

## Overview

This folder contains [ICU Message Format](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages) JSON representations of all of the languages that are supported by both Watson Assistant dialog skills and the web chat widget. Web chat defaults to English (US), but you can pass in an object of language strings with
[the updateLanguagePack](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methods#languages) method.
